PostScript/XYChart version 0.01
===============================

This module creates a graph from either a file or an array of points.  The graph
is written to a postscript file, either for printing directly or in EPS format
for inclusion in another file.

It would be used as follows:
    (a) Create an XYChart object using the defaults or any of over 140 options.
    (b) Use the line_from_file() method to read graph data from a CSV file.
    (c) Call build_chart() to assemble the postscript code which draws the graph.
    (d) Use the output() method to save the postscript file.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

The t directory holds some scripts which can be used to test the module.  I have
yet to work these up into proper tests.  To run the tests, cd to the directory
first as they expect to find files there.

DEPENDENCIES
